It is a real sports club web page created with HTML, CSS, JS and PHP and hosted on Hostgator. You can visit the web page [Here](http://lapiletadeliliana.com/ "Here")
It is my personal project in witch I am working to apply the knowledge that I am learning during my courses
The hosting database is used for the same sports club and its client databases developed with Django, [StudentsDB](https://github.com/MateoBres/StudentsDB "StudentsDB")

The challenges were to send the client data form by email to the sports club administration and to configure a hosting website and the Google SEO for the first time.
